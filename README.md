Despite its name, it is a gentle introduction to Python.

However, since it is out of date:

- Chapter 0 'Installing Python': maybe it should also introduce bpython/ipython and [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv).
- Chapter 2 'Native Datatypes' should also introduce named tuple.
- Chapter 12 'XML' better to introduce [pyquery](https://github.com/gawel/pyquery) instead.
- Chapter 14 'HTTP Web Services' should introduce [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) instead.
- Chapter 16 'Packaging Python Libraries' should introduce setuptools and pip instead.
